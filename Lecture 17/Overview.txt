CLASS 17 (9th Jan, Thursday):

Structure:
- Identical binary trees
- Symmetric/Mirror tree


Root to Leaf:
- Is there a path with a specific sum
- If path exists, print one such path
- Print all such paths
- Print all paths lexicographically
- Find sum of all root to leaf path numbers if each node represents a digit


Height/Depth:
- Min depth
- Max depth
- Determine if a tree is height balanced
- Diameter of the tree


Tree Construction:
- Binary tree from given inorder and preorder (O(n2), O(n)=>When only unique elements in the tree)
- Binary tree from given inorder and postorder
- Binary tree from given inorder and level order
- Sorted array to balanced BST
- Why does preorder and postorder not give a unique tree?
- Complete Binary Tree from its Linked List/Array rep


Node successors and predecessors
